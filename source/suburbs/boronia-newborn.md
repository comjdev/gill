## Relaxed newborn photography in Boronia with a calm, baby-led approach

Hi, I'm a lifestyle photographer based in Boronia with over 10 years of experience capturing real, heartfelt moments for families across Melbourne. I specialise in **newborn photography**, as well as **maternity** and **family photos**, all with a storytelling approach. Before I became a photographer, I studied writing and now I use both forms of storytelling to preserve the fleeting, beautiful moments that define your family’s early days.

This page is dedicated to **newborn photography** in **Boronia**, documenting those early weeks with your baby in a gentle, natural way that feels easy and real.

## Newborn photos in Boronia

My sessions aren’t staged or overly posed. I don't work in a studio, instead, I offer in-home **newborn sessions** and relaxed outdoor shoots around **Boronia** and surrounding areas like the **Dandenong Ranges** and **Mornington Peninsula**. Whether we’re capturing cosy moments in your lounge room or a golden-hour walk through a leafy trail, I aim to tell your family’s story with honesty and heart.

With a gentle, baby-led approach, I focus on keeping everyone comfortable. There's no need to stress about tidying up, I’ll help shift things as we go. What matters most is documenting the real love, connection, and wonder in these early days.

## Newborn photos in Boronia with real moments, beautifully told

There’s something magical about this newborn stage, tiny toes, soft snuggles, and those sleepy newborn stretches. But it all passes so quickly. My goal is to create a relaxed space where you can just *be* with your baby while I quietly capture the in-between moments: the way you hold them, the way they settle into your chest, and the small details that you’ll want to remember forever.

These **newborn sessions** are calm, never rushed, and designed entirely around your baby’s needs, ideal for first-time parents or families welcoming a new sibling.

### In-home newborn photography in Boronia

Your home is more than just a setting, it’s the heart of your family life. Whether your living room is full of toys, laundry, or soft morning light, it’s the perfect place for **baby photos** that feel deeply personal. You don't need a Pinterest-perfect space, what matters is that it’s yours.

In-home **newborn photos** in Boronia allow you to stay relaxed in a familiar environment, with time for feeding, changing, and cuddling as needed. We’ll move at your pace and find the most beautiful light in your everyday surroundings.

### Outdoor newborn photography in Boronia and beyond

If you're more drawn to nature, Boronia offers beautiful spots for peaceful outdoor photos. We might visit a quiet park nearby or venture into the **Dandenong Ranges** for a stunning natural backdrop. I also photograph families along the coast, including **Mornington Peninsula** sessions that combine fresh air and soft, golden light.

Outdoor sessions are great for families with older siblings too, kids can explore, play, and just be themselves while we capture real connection.
