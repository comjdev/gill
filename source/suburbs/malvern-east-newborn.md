## Capturing your baby’s first days in Malvern East with honest, heartfelt newborn photography

I’m a lifestyle photographer with over ten years of experience, passionate about documenting the real, beautiful stories of families across **Malvern East** and beyond.

My **newborn photography** sessions in **Malvern East** are all about natural, relaxed storytelling, capturing your little one just as they are, in the comfort of your own home.

As a mum myself, I know just how quickly the newborn phase slips through your fingers. I often find myself wishing I had more photos from those first weeks, which is why I’m so passionate about helping you hold onto those memories while they’re still fresh.
