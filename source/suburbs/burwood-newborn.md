## Natural and relaxed newborn photos for Burwood families

Hi, I’m a lifestyle photographer with over a decade of experience capturing honest, heartfelt moments for families across Melbourne. I specialise in **newborn photography**, as well as **maternity photos** and relaxed, joy-filled **family sessions**. Before photography, I studied writing, and now I combine those storytelling skills with my camera to document the beautifully real and fleeting early days with your baby.

My approach is gentle, baby-led, and designed to make you feel completely at ease. I photograph in a lifestyle way, no formal studio setups, just soft, natural light and meaningful moments, whether that’s in the comfort of your **Burwood** home or a relaxed outdoor setting. These first days with your newborn are precious and fast-moving. My goal is to help you slow it all down for just a moment and capture memories with sweet **newborn photos** you’ll treasure for a lifetime.

## Newborn photos in Burwood

One of the most common things I hear from new parents is, “I’d love **newborn photos**, but I’m just not ready.” But here’s the thing, you _are_ ready. You’ve just had a baby, and that’s extraordinary. Please don’t worry about tidying up or making your home look perfect. I’ll gently work around the natural flow of your space, and we’ll tidy as we go if needed. Your comfort, and your baby’s, is always the top priority.

To help things run smoothly, I bring everything we need for your baby’s individual photos, a comfy beanbag, a few soft blankets, and a selection of neutral wraps. This way, you can relax knowing the details are taken care of, and you don’t need to prepare anything in advance for your **newborn photos** experience.

## Capturing those first few days as your Burwood newborn photographer

Whether we’re photographing in your light-filled lounge room or curled up by the window in your baby’s nursery, my sessions are relaxed and completely baby-led. We’ll capture a mix of peaceful individual shots of your newborn and those beautiful in-between moments with you, from the way you hold them, the sleepy yawns, the tender glances. These aren’t just photos; they’re a quiet love story of your baby’s first days.

If you’d prefer an outdoor session once your baby is a little older, there are lovely nearby locations such as **Wattle Park** or the open spaces along **Gardiners Creek Trail**, perfect for adding a touch of nature to your **baby photos**.

## A lasting gift for your baby

These **newborn photo**s are more than just keepsakes for you, they’re a gift for your baby, too. One day, they’ll look back at these images and see just how loved and cherished they were from the very beginning. In a time they won’t remember, you’ll be giving them a tangible piece of their story with these **newborn photos**. These are the first pages in their visual history.

## A laid-back photography experience for Burwood families

My sessions are never rushed. You’ve just entered a brand-new chapter, and we’ll take all the time we need for feeding, settling, or simply taking a breath. Whether it’s your first baby or your fifth, every newborn session is tailored to your unique family dynamic. I’m there not just as your **newborn photographer**, but as someone who understands how precious, and sometimes overwhelming, this time can be.
