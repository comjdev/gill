## Capturing your Bayswater family story with natural lifestyle photography

I'm a photographer with over a decade of experience capturing the beautiful journey of families in and around Bayswater. While I also specialise in documenting the anticipation of new life with **maternity photography** and the delicate wonder of **newborn photos**, this page is dedicated to celebrating the joy and connection of family through natural and relaxed photography sessions right here in Bayswater. I embrace a lifestyle approach, photographing families in the comfort of their own homes and at various beautiful outdoor locations, including the stunning **Dandenong Ranges** and the picturesque coastline. My aim is to make everyone feel at ease, ensuring a fun and memorable experience where genuine moments are captured.
