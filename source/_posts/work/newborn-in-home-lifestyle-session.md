## Newborn lifestyle session in Melbourne

There was something extra special about photographing this sweet baby girl as she was the very first birth I’d ever photographed. Being in the room as a couple gets to meet their baby and watching them gaze at her in awe is pretty damn special. Getting to see Casey a week later and see how they’d settled in as a family was so great and made taking these **newborn photos** even more special.

## Why this is my favourite part of the job

Whenever somebody asks me what I love the most about my job, I tell them it’s exactly this. It’s getting to be there for so many big moments in people’s lives. It really is pretty great.
