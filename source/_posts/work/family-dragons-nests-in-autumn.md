## The Dandenong Ranges in Autumn

You never know what weather you’re going to get with **Melbourne**, especially during late Autumn but these guys and I got lucky. It was pretty cold but the sun came out just long enough for us to have some fun and look how magical it looks shining through the trees. Gosh it was beautiful.

## Family photos that are more of an adventure

We had so much fun exploring the area. I’m not much of a ‘sit down and smile for the camera’ type of photographer. It means kids can be kids & we get **family photos** that actually show a snippet of the real them. No cheesy grins and not knowing what to do with your hands. But fun moments together that make you smile when you look back at the photos. I know these are the sort of **family photos** I wish for of my own family.

## One of my favourite locations in the Dandenong Ranges

Lastly, these were taken at one of my absolute favourite locations at the bottom of the **Dandenong Ranges**! A spot that looks beautiful no matter what the weather is. It’s always relatively quiet and it really just feels like we’re going for a walk together, playing in the beautiful forest that you forget I’m also taking your photo. I’ve photographed many families here over the years and I really don’t tire of it.
If you'd like this forest setting for your own **family photos**, let me know!
