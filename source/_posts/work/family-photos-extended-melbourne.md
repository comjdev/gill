## Extended Family Photos

This was a truly special session with a secret mission! These four sisters wanted to surprise their mum at Christmas with updated photos to replace some of the older, outdated ones in her house. We spent the session capturing the beautiful bond between the four of them, as well as plenty of fun moments with all the grandkids. 

## Embracing the fog for these beautiful family photos

We were worried it was going to rain on this afternoon and while it was cold, this beautiful fog rolled in. How stunning does it look? These 4 sisters really nailed the outfit and colour choices for these **family photos**. The blues and whites/creams all work so well together, without being ‘too-coordinated’. **Extended family shoots** can be a little overwhelming but I absolutely love the results of these.
