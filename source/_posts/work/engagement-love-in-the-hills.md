## Engagement - love in the hills

This has been one of my favourite engagement shoots to date. We spent a hot summer evening getting lost in the beautiful hills of the Dandenong Ranges and whilst these two swore they were awkward in front of the camera, I told a bunch of bad jokes to set the mood and we captured some magic.
