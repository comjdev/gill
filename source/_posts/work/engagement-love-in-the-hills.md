## Dandenong Ranges engagement photos: a love story in the hills

This has been one of my favourite **engagement shoots** to date. We spent a beautiful summer evening getting lost in the stunning hills of the **Dandenong Ranges**. While this couple swore they were awkward in front of the camera, I told a bunch of bad jokes to set the mood and we captured some magic. **Engagement photos** don’t have to be awkward, I promise!

## The perfect start to your journey together with engagement photos

Your engagement is a unique and exciting time, a moment in your story that is just about the two of you. These **engagement photos** are a beautiful way to document this chapter before the whirlwind of wedding planning begins. They serve as a tangible reminder of your love story and are a celebration of who you are as a couple right now. Capturing these moments in a place as beautiful as the **Dandenong Ranges** provides the perfect backdrop for the beginning of your forever.

## Why the Dandenong Ranges are perfect for engagement photos

The **Dandenong Ranges** offer a beautiful setting for **engagement photos**. How lucky are we to have them just a short drive from **Melbourne**! There’s something kinda’ magical about the way the light falls in between the towering trees. Whether you're looking for a fairytale forest vibe or a breathtaking view over the **Yarra Valley**, the **Dandenong Ranges** provide the perfect natural backdrop for your love story. This beautiful scenery allows for an intimate and relaxed session, where you can simply enjoy being together while I document your journey.
