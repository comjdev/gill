## Baby bump in The Dandenong Ranges with maternity photos

There’s something extra special about a maternity session when you’re pregnant yourself especially when you share the exact same due date. I mean, what are the chances! Although I was a bit slower than usual, as I waddled around on swollen ankles, I really enjoyed taking these **maternity photos** while pregnant myself.


## Why maternity photos are more than just images

This was one of my last sessions before having my own baby, and I so enjoyed it. I believe that **maternity photos** are more than just a picture of a baby bump; they're a celebration of a family's beginning. Getting to document this exciting time for a couple, full of anticipation for the future, is really special. I love knowing that these photos will be a cherished part of their family's story, a beautiful reminder of the journey they took to bring their little one home.
