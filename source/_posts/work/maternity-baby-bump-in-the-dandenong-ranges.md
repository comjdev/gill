## Baby bump in The Dandenong Ranges

There’s something extra special about a maternity session when you’re pregnant yourself especially when you share the exact same due date. This was one of my last sessions before having my own baby and I SO enjoyed it. Documenting such an exciting time for a couple is pretty special.
