## Family lifestyle session in Melbourne

I loved getting to be a part of this brother and sister’s world for the morning. It’s pretty exciting to get to shoot in people’s homes and be a part of their world for a couple of hours. Kids especially love showing their bedrooms, favourite toys and I love their excitement in it.

## What I love about in home lifestyle sessions in Melbourne

I love in-home **lifestyle sessions** because kids are usually pretty comfortable in their own space. They like showing their favourite toys and I really enjoy getting to be a part of it. There’s no being asked to sit still and smile for the camera, just fun and giggles while I snap away and leave you with **family photos** that really show a part of their childhood.

P.s. how amazing is the antique rocking horse!
