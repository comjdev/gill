## In home lifestyle fun

Iâd taken Stephâs maternity photos six months before, which meant I was really looking forward to this family shoot. Oscarâs a very lucky baby as it quickly became obvious Steph and Amveth are crazy about him. With that full head of hair and gummy grin, who wouldnât be? He was also one of the most relaxed and happiest babies Iâve met and really, a pleasure to take photos of. I absolutely love the photos we got and this is definitely one of my favourite shoots to date. These in-home, lifestyle sessions are my absolute favourite. People just being themselves and being together while I quietly shoot away. Winter is also the perfect time to update your family photos with an in-home lifestyle session. We were all inside in the warmth and not bothered by Melbourneâs cold weather. Perfect!
