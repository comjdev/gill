## In home lifestyle family photos fun in Melbourne

After taking Steph's **maternity photos** six months ago, I couldn't wait for this **family shoot**. I'd been so excited for them to meet their little one, and now I got to see them all as a family. Honestly, getting to follow along on people's journeys like this is the best part of my job. You get to see a beautiful story unfold in real time, and it's so special to be the one to capture it for them.

## A beautiful family connection

Oscar’s a very lucky baby as it quickly became obvious Steph and Amveth are crazy about him. With that full head of hair and gummy grin, who wouldn’t be? He was also one of the most relaxed and happiest babies I’ve met and really, a pleasure to take photos of. I absolutely love the **family photos** we got and this is definitely one of my favourite shoots to date.

## Why in-home lifestyle session are my favourite here in Melbourne

These **in-home, lifestyle sessions** are my absolute favourite. People just being themselves and being together while I quietly shoot away. Winter is also the perfect time to update your **family photos** with an in-home lifestyle session. We were all inside in the warmth and not bothered by **Melbourne’s** cold weather. Perfect!
