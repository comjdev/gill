## In home lifestyle fun

I'd taken Steph's maternity photos six months before, which meant I was really looking forward to this family shoot. Oscar's a very lucky baby as it quickly became obvious Steph and Amveth are crazy about him. With that full head of hair and gummy grin, who wouldn't be? He was also one of the most relaxed and happiest babies I've met and really, a pleasure to take photos of. I absolutely love the photos we got and this is definitely one of my favourite shoots to date. These in-home, lifestyle sessions are my absolute favourite. People just being themselves and being together while I quietly shoot away. Winter is also the perfect time to update your family photos with an in-home lifestyle session. We were all inside in the warmth and not bothered by Melbourne's cold weather. Perfect!
