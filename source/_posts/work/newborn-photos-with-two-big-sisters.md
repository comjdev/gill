## Ready for adventures with two big sisters

Baby Archie is the third baby for this family and wow is he in for a lot of fun growing up! His two big sisters were full of beans and energy and I’m sure he’ll be matching it in no time. They were busy doing their own playful things nearby while we took these **newborn photos**, curious enough to be close by and see what we were up to, before joining in for a few photos. Gosh, I can just imagine the antics that they’ll get up to as they grow!

## Including toddlers in newborn photos

Families often worry about toddlers coopering during **newborn photos** but I don’t! I love the energy that they bring and we’ll involve them as little or as much as they wish on the day.
