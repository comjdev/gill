## Hello Baby Mila

This is sweet baby Mila who I was super lucky to take newborn photos of. I photographed her 'big' sister, Charlotte 18 months before and it was so nice to see how she's grown and see her in her new 'big sister' role. Jess is an old friend of mine, which makes photographing her girls that little bit more special. I can only imagine the mischief these 2 girls are going to get up to in no time at all. x
