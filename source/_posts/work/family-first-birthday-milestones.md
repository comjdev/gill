## First birthday milestones: a celebration in photos

What better way to celebrate your baby’s first birthday than by updating your **family photos**? Those first twelve months are a whirlwind of growth and change. From their tiny newborn days to their first smiles, laughs, and wobbly steps, so much happens that it's so important to document it all along the way. By the time babies reach that one-year mark, their unique personalities are really starting to shine, making it the perfect time to capture all their adorable new traits.

## A beautiful location for family photos in Olinda

I absolutely love shooting at this spot in **Olinda**, nestled in the beautiful **Dandenong Ranges**. I explore here often with my own kids, and it honestly looks beautiful all year round. It makes the most amazing backdrop for **family photos**, no matter the season. And if it happens to be busy, we can always find a quiet area where your family can enjoy their photo session.

## Capturing Your Family's Unique Story

My goal is to create a relaxed and joyful experience for your **family photos**. There’s no pressure for perfect poses or forced smiles, instead, we focus on capturing the authentic connection and love within your family. I always do my best to make sure everyone is comfortable and relaxed. These photos will not only mark your baby's first birthday milestone but also give you beautiful memories of this time.
