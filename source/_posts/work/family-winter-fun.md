## Winter fun

Okay what is it with babies looking so cute in beanies. I certainly don't look anywhere near as good :D These were taken in the Dandenong Ranges in winter and how subtle and pretty do these colours look? Wooly jumpers, babies in beanies and these gorgeous colours are definite pros to having photos taken in winter.
