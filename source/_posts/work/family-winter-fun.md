## Winter fun with family photos in the Dandenong Ranges

Okay what is it with babies looking so cute in beanies. I certainly don’t look anywhere near as good :D These were taken in **Olinda**, in the **Dandenong Ranges** in winter and how subtle and pretty do these colours look?

## What makes family photos taken in winter so special

I get why outdoor photos during winter in **Melbourne** don’t sound appealing but wooly jumpers, babies in beanies and these gorgeous colours are definite pros to having photos taken in winter. And when that winter light shows up, it’s so soft and beautiful, I really love shooting in.

If you’re after **family photos** in this beautiful spot in the **Dandenong Ranges**, let me know :)
