## Newborn photos in Melbourne with baby Charlotte

These guys are good friends of mine so you can imagine my excitement at photographing them with their first baby. Jess and I have known each other since we were teenagers and here we are many years later, with our own babies. My Mia (5 years old) tagged along with me to be my assistant for the day and she absolutely loved it. She loves babies, she loves bossing me around and she loves taking photos so she was right in her element at this **newborn shoot**.

## Photographing friends

It’s funny but I always get a bit nervous photographing friends and their families. You’d think it would be the opposite but I guess I put even more pressure on myself to deliver beautiful photos. Photographing Jess with her first baby was pretty special to me and I have no doubt these **newborn photos** will be looked at for years to come. 
Oh and I'm always up for the challenge of including family pets! Even if they're cats who'd much rather be doing anything else :D I think we got there though and I love the ones that include their fur baby too.
