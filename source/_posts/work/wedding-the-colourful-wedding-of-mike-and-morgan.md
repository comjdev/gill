## The colourful wedding of Mike and Morgan

Mike and Morgan’s biggest priority for their wedding day was to simply have fun. They can definitely tick that off their list! This wedding was filled with so much fun and so much laughter from start to finish. The details that went into their big day made their day SO much ‘them’ that it really was perfect. Their gorgeous fur baby, Diesel was dressed for the occasion and got to see his Mum and Dad getting married. Any wedding where there’s a dog involved, I’m there!! A huge congratulations to one of my favourite couples. I absolutely loved being apart of your big day and most importantly, had so much fun x
