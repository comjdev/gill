## Winter fun in the hills

The Peters family were a lot of fun to photograph. We took these photos in the Dandenong ranges and in typical Melbourne style, we had to reschedule due to rain but only once, which I guess is not bad for mid-winter. Most families get photos done when they have their babies and maybe a couple of times when their babies are toddlers or a little bit older. But then life gets busy and older kids are more reluctant to have their photos taken, which means a lot of families never get around to it. But remember, your kids will never look the same as they do right now. Iâ€™m sure these pre-teen girls are going to look a whole lot different in a couple of years, which makes these photos even more special.
