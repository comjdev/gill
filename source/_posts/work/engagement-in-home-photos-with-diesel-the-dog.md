## Engagement - in home photos with Diesel the dog

With each wedding, I offer to do an engagement session as this really gives us a chance to get to know each other. After all, I am going to be there for a large part of your wedding day! Michael and Morgan decided theyâd love to have their engagement photos taken in their home in Melbourne. This is their first home together and I could immediately see how much love and effort theyâd put into the place. Each room seemed to have itsâ own story and I so loved integrating this into our shoot. And donât let me forget their beautiful fur baby, Diesel. He really stole the show and I have a feeling heâll be doing the same thing on their actual wedding day, not that theyâd mind I donât think he could be any more loved and he LITERALLY smiled for the camera for me. I mean, what more could you ask for. I am so looking forward to being a part of Michael and Morganâs wedding day later in 2019.
