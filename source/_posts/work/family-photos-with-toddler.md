## Family photos. A little fun and a little chaotic

These were the first **family photos** for these guys and I’ll let you know a little secret. While there was lots of laughter and sweet moments, there were also a lot of chaotic ones! 1 year old Josh was pretty strong willed with what he wanted to do and where he wanted to go, which wasn’t always what we wanted. Typical for toddlers right? But we let him take the lead and guess what ... he had fun and we still got lots of beautiful **family photos**.

## Beautiful family photos hanging in their home

Mum, Jenny, has since sent me a video of the images she printed and framed and they look so beautiful hanging in their home. I know photo sessions with toddlers can be chaotic and exhausting but they really are worth it once you’ve got the end result of beautiful **family photos** hanging in your home.

## Let’s simplify having your family photos taken

One more thing I want to say about this shoot is that they were taken at a reserve just down the road from me in the **Eastern suburbs of Melbourne**. Sure, there are lots of beautiful locations around **Melbourne** but sometimes when you’ve got a wriggly toddler it just starts to all feel too hard. So, let’s simplify it. Let’s pick somewhere local and make updating your **family photos** feel much easier.
