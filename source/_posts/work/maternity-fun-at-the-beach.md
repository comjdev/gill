## Fun maternity photos at the beach

What I love about these **maternity photos** the most? How much fun we had! It wasn’t overly warm but Rachel embraced the experience and had a lot of fun in the waves, all while documenting her bump. And when she sent me a msg asking if she should bring her sequin robe, it was a big yes from me!

## Making these maternity photos her own

Another reminder that these are your photos and they should look exactly as you want them to. So, if you want to dance around in the ocean in sequins for your **maternity photos** – I’m all for it!
