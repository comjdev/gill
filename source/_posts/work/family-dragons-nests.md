## Family photos nestled in Kallista, The Dandenong Ranges

The wonderful Jacqui was nominated in a recent competition I ran, giving away a **family shoot** and I’m so happy that she won. We took the photos in one of my favourite places at the foot of the **Dandenong Ranges**. One of the things I love the most about this location is just how much fun kids have here. There’s something kinda’ magical about the place and I love seeing kids explore and have fun. It’s while they’re having all this fun that they forget that we’re also there to take some **family photos**, which means the photos are always genuine and joyful.

## Fun and stress-free family photos in the Dandenong Ranges

**Family photos** really don’t have to feel forced and stressful. Think of where your kids would have the most fun and let’s go there! We’ll take them on an adventure just like we did here. We searched for dragons, hoped for fairies and built teepees amongst the beautiful forest that is the Dandenong Ranges.
