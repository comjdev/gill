## Family - dragons' nests

The wonderful Jacqui was nominated in a recent competition I ran giving away an entire family shoot and Iâm so happy that she won. We shot in one of my favourite places at the foot of the Dandenong Ranges and her girls had so much fun exploring while I took some updated photos for them. We searched for dragons, we built a teepee and lots of giggles were had.
