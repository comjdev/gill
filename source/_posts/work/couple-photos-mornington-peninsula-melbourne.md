## Photos that celebrate you as a couple

A photoshoot that simply celebrates you as a couple? Yes, please! Iâ€™m all for it. These two simply wanted photos with each other and we sure had fun with it! **Couple photos** don't need to be awkward at all. Choose a location that you love, wear something you feel good in and I promise, you'll love the results!

## The beautiful yet wild clifftops along the Mornington Peninsula 

This beautiful spot along the **Mornington Peninsula** is a popular location for photographers and when you look through this series of photos, you can see why. The colours, the wind and of course, the views add such a beautiful backdrop to your photos.
