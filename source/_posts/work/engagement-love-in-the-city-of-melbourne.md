## Engagement - love in the city of Melbourne

I don’t get to shoot in the city too often so I was pretty excited that’s where these 2 wanted their engagement photos taken. They have so many memories in Melbourne from their first date, first kiss, where they’d just gotten engaged and so many in-between. We stopped by all of them while they reminisced on the last couple of years and I so loved getting to document this for them. They also asked to have their dog included in the photos, which I absolutely loved. Dogs are always welcome at my sessions!
