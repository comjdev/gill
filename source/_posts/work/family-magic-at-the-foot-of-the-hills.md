## Magic at the foot of the hills

After having photographed this family last year we'd stayed in touch and they felt more like friends than clients, which made me super excited for this session, especially when Miss Sienna greeted me with a big hug. We danced, we played, we picked flowers and genuinely had a good time on this summer evening.
