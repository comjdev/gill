## Family photos in the forest of the Dandenong Ranges

This was one of those shoots that got rescheduled many times because of covid lockdowns. Which means it made these **family photos** that extra bit sweet.

## Why play-based photos always win

Mum told me before the session that Liam can be quite shy and she was worried he wouldn’t want much to do with photos but I absolutely love how these turned out. I love it when parents really embrace the experience and just play with their kids, which is exactly what this couple did. I don’t think Liam even noticed that we were taking photos because he was too busy having fun. Just how **family photos** should be!
