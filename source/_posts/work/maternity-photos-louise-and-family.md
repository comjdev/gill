## Family photos, baby bump included

I love the idea of having **family photos** taken while you’re nearing the end of your pregnancy as it’s marking another milestone. It’s capturing your family before it grows and welcomes a new member.
I’d taken Louise’s **maternity photos** during her last pregnancy, which made these even more exciting. It’s funny how adding another child to the shoot changed the dynamic so much. The last **maternity shoot** felt a lot quieter!

## Family photo fun in the Dandenong Ranges

This shoot was very focused around making it an adventure for the two girls, Evie and Isla. I think incorporating play is so important when taking **family photos**. Kids should enjoy the whole experience and feel like it was a fun outing, rather than something they don’t want to do again.
