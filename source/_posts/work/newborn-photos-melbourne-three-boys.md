## Newborn photos with Lucas and his big brothers 

These **newborn photos** were taken in this family’s home on the outskirts of **Melbourne**. Lucas is the third boy for this family and I can already tell this is going to be a lively household! I’d love to be a fly on the wall over the years and see some of the antics they get up to :D

## A beautiful continuation from bump to baby

What made these **newborn photos** that little bit more special is I’d also taken **maternity photos** for Rachel. As a photographer, it really is wonderful to get to tag along in some of people’s biggest milestones. It’s not something I take lightly and I hope these photos capture this chapter for them perfectly.

## A special offer for bump to baby bookings

Did you know I also offer a discount when you book in a **maternity session** as well as a **newborn session**. The two booked together really tell a story of this special time for you. If you'd like to know, please reach out!
