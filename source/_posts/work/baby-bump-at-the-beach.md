## Baby bump at the beach

I'm more of a summer person than a winter person but these maternity photos of Sarah's bare bump and knitted jumper in this beautiful winter light might have won me over. The colours of the sky and beach were so soft and pretty. If only every winter evening in Melbourne was like this! I SO enjoyed taking these photos, hearing about Sarah's pregnancy journey and documenting this special time for her :-)
