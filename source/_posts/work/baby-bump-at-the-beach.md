## Baby bump at the beach in Melbourne

I'm more of a summer person than a winter person but these **maternity photos** of Sarah's bare bump and knitted jumper in this beautiful winter light might have won me over. The colours of the sky and beach were so soft and pretty. If only every winter evening in **Melbourne** was like this! I SO enjoyed taking these photos, hearing about Sarah's pregnancy journey and documenting this special time for her.

## Maternity photos that look like you

Remember, these are your **maternity photos**! You can show as much or as little skin as you're comfortable with. You can wear whatever feels right for you. I remember when I was pregnant I felt huge and I really struggled with what to wear when it was my turn for **maternity photos**. I went with a long flowy dress that made me feel slightly less huge :D
