## Maternity photos in Melbourne

This is an old friend of mine and her family. There’s always something extra special, and nerve wracking, about being asked to take photos for a friend. This location in **Olinda** is also one of my favourite locations so as you can imagine, I was pretty excited for this shoot!

## The perfect time for family photos

I’m not sure if this is more of a **maternity shoot** or a **family shoot** or just a sweet balance of both. While Louise wanted to document her pregnancy, she also wanted photos of them as a family right now, before they become a family of 4. What a perfect time for **family photos**, if you ask me!
