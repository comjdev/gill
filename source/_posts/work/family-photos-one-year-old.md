## One year olds bring so much personality 

One year olds have to be one of my favourite age-groups to photograph. They bring so much personality and well, theyâ€™re just really cute. Baby Emmett was no different! He was keen to get outside so we started off outside in their family garden. Documenting memories where they spend lots of time together felt perfect for this family and their **family photos**. 

## Relaxed family photos taken at home

These **family photos** were super relaxed. Baby Emmett got to play outside with his mums at their home in **Melbourne**, read some books in his room and get plenty of cuddles as he started to get tired. No fuss, no travel time and minimal effort. Your home is part of your family story and I love it when families decide to make it their backdrop for their photos.
