## Newborn Photos of sweet baby, Rayne

I attended a workshop earlier in the year with a photographer I have admired for so long. As a photographer, I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and I'm not sure I'll ever stop learning. I learnt so much from this workshop about the art of newborn photography and these photos were all about putting what I learnt into practise.

I love going into people's homes for sessions. It's so much more personal to be in your own space with your own belongs and I get to be a part of their 'newborn bubble' for a few hours.

I really wanted these images to be simple. I want that I can go in to any home, with any light and create simple yet beautiful photos of your baby and these are exactly what I walked away with. Newborn photos don't need a fancy set up. I arrived with my newborn posing beanbag, some blankets and wraps and we were all set. Baby Rayne sure did make us work for these photos but I'm so happy with the end result that it was SO worth it.
