## Fun at Flinders

This is one of the most popular places to take photos at on the Mornington Peninsula and it's easy to see why. We had so much fun exploring and thanks to 2 year old Sebastian, I got my exercise for the day :D If you're worried that your kids would never stay still long enough for photos, don't worry! Most don't and that's the way I love it. We explore, we have fun and it really shows in the photos.
