There’s something I find a bit special about a **family shoot** that includes grown up kids. We take so many photos of our kids when they’re little and then it’s like the older they get the less photos we take. This family shoot was organised by Alisha, for her mum-in-law as a gift, again, so special. **Family photos** aren’t just for toddlers splashing in the waves; they're about documenting your family exactly as you are, however that may look right now. Every family dynamic changes over the years and it’s so important to document the different stages.

## Including family pets in family photos

When booking this shoot in, Alisha asked if their **dogs** could be included. And coming from someone who has 2 dogs and absolutely sees them as an extension of our family, this was a big yes from me! Pets bring a whole other level of personality to a session that I really love.

## Why Fitzroy Gardens in Melbourne made the perfect backdrop

We chose this beautiful location within **Melbourne** where we could combine the greenery of nature and then the beautiful architecture that you find at the **Fitzroy Gardens** Conservatory. Gosh I really loved it. It’s such a versatile location and also challenged me as a photographer. An added bonus? There’s plenty of room for the dogs!

## Location, location, location. Choosing your family's ideal setting in Melbourne

This **family shoot** was also such a good reminder about choosing a location that really suits you as a family and suits your style. Before choosing a green forest backdrop, have a think about if these are really the colours you want on your walls. This location within **Melbourne** really suited this family and the backdrop they wanted in their photos.
