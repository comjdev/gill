## In-home newborn photos for Charles

There’s always something extra exciting and special about taking photos (especially **newborn photos**) for friends and family members and this is exactly what this was. This is my cousin and his family, with baby Charles who  is the first baby born in our family in a long time!

## All babies are different

It’s funny how from the moment babies are born they can be so different. I know that from my own two kids. One was super chilled and one just wasn’t! Well, baby Charles was super chilled and slept through all his **newborn photos**. Barely batted an eyelid as we moved him.
