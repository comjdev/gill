## Newborn photos with Noah in Melbourne

Noah was such a chilled baby to photograph and I love how his **newborn photos** turned out. These were taken in-home in the Eastern suburbs of **Melbourne**. It’s amazing how you can do similar posing with newborns and the photos can look so different. I found out very quickly that Noah was happiest on his belly with his hand resting under his cheek – picture perfect! I took so many photos of him like this because he just looked so happy and content.

## My style of newborn photography is simple but …

My style of **newborn photography** is simple and timeless but when Dad told me he is a volunteer with the CFA and asked if we could try a photo with Noah in his uniform pocket, how could I say no! Don’t worry, his safety was our number 1 priority and there are many hands edited out of those photos that were there keeping him safe.

## Remember, this is YOUR newborn shoot

If you book a **newborn shoot** with me and have a special request, like this family did, please let me know! I won’t make any promises and your baby’s safety is always my priority but I’m happy to give them a go and add these personal and sentimental factors in.
