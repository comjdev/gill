## Love in the Yarra Valley

This was a beautiful, intimate wedding which brought these two and their families together from different parts of the world. They said their i-do’s in Melbourne to a room filled with their loved ones on a cold and rainy, Melbourne day. The super talented bride, Sonja made her dress herself and the day was filled with many more personal touches. Sonja and Mac sure knew how to make an entrance and landed at Oakridge winery in the Yarra Valley by helicopter. Not only do they love flying in helicopters but Oakridge winery is one of their favourite places. All their guests got to warm up in the cellar with mulled wine and wait for the happy couple to arrive. Oakridge winery in the Yarra Valley is a beautiful location and I can see why Sonja and Mac are fond of it. They also couldn’t have ended their day more perfectly, flying off into the sunset to enjoy married life.
