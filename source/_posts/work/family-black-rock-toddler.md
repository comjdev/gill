## A perfect summer evening for family photos at the beach

This was one of those perfect summer evenings at **Black Rock** beach. You know, where it’s still quite warm and there is no wind. The kind where you can play in the water and even though the sun’s going down it’s more refreshing than cold. Really, it was the perfect evening to be taking **family photos** at the beach. And considering how often I have to reschedule shoots because of the weather, it makes evenings like this even more enjoyable.

## Making first and memories together with family photo

This was my second time photographing this family but our first time at the beach and they told me it was baby Josh’s first time playing in the waves. How special! I’ll always be honoured to be a part of so many big moments for people. **Family photos** like this are such a joy to be a part of.
