## My Personal Experience with Family Photography Chaos

Let me tell you a little secret: I've seen it all. And I mean all. As a family photographer, I've witnessed the sweetest smiles and the most epic toddler tantrums. But nothing quite prepared me for the day my own two-year-old decided to unleash his inner wild child during our family photos. Yes, you heard that right! The photographer's son.

We were at a stunning Mornington Peninsula location, perched atop beautiful cliffs overlooking the ocean. Picture-perfect, right? Wrong. Harrison transformed into a tiny, cliff-running daredevil, ignoring every word we said. He'd never been a runner before, but he was making up for lost time! It was a chaotic, heart-stopping, and slightly hilarious experience.

So, my point to that little story is, when I say that I get the chaos that toddlers bring to a family session, I REALLY do get it. I whole heartedly, 100% get it.

## Why Natural, Playful Moments Matter

Forget forced smiles and stiff poses! I believe that letting kids have fun is the key to capturing genuine moments. Once they're engaged in play, they forget about the camera, and that's when the magic happens. Their true personalities shine, and the session transforms from a photoshoot into a fun, memorable outing. Whether we're at the beach, in a park, or exploring a forest, it becomes an adventure.

Of course, I'll still guide you as a family, helping you make the most of the beautiful light and location and ensuring you don't feel awkward or unsure of what to do. But my priority is creating a fun and relaxed experience for everyone.

Ultimately, I want your family photos to be a reflection of your joy and connection. So, ditch the stress, embrace the chaos, and join in the fun. Because those candid, playful moments are the ones you'll treasure most. And when your kids look back at these images, I want them to remember how much fun they had, not how much they had to pose. I want them to see the love and laughter that fills your family, captured in a way that feels authentic and real. Let's create some memories together!

## Essential Tips for Your Family Photography Session

A few more practical tips are below for all Family Photography sessions with me.

### 1. Have Fun Together

Have fun! Wherever we are, try and enjoy the time together as a family.

### 2. Choose Comfortable Clothing

Wear clothes you love. Whether you want to get a little bit dressed up or wear your everyday clothes that feel most like you, make sure you’re all comfortable and feel like yourselves.

### 3. Pack Spare Clothes

Spare clothes for everyone. Yep, the grown ups too! Nothing like instinctively picking up a wet toddler at the beach before realising your pants are now soaked. Best to pack a spare set you’re happy to have photographed so that everyone has something else to wear as a back up plan.

### 4. Bring Snacks for Kids

Bring snacks. Children can get overwhelmed or tired during their session and sometimes their favourite snack can be the perfect distraction to getting a few more photos.

### 5. Prepare for Melbourne Weather

Prepare for all weather conditions. This is Melbourne and we all know how unpredictable the weather can be! Ensure you have clothes appropriate to the weather conditions.

### 6. Choose the Right Location

Choose a location you love. If your kids hate the feel of sand on their feet, then the beach is definitely not for them! Whether it be your home, one of my suggested locations or somewhere that has sentimental value to your family, make sure it’s somewhere you all enjoy being.

### 7. Allow Plenty of Time

Give yourself plenty of time on the day. Make sure everyone has eaten and is ready for your family shoot with plenty of time to spare. Especially if it’s a sunset shoot. Nothing worse than getting stuck in traffic as the sun’s going down and we’re losing light!

### 8. Trust Your Photographer

Trust. Lastly and maybe most importantly. Trust me. I love what I do. I’m confident in what I do and I’ll work with your family to get images that feel authentically you and that you really love.
