## Newborn Photography in and Around the Suburbs of Melbourne

Bringing a new life into the world is a whirlwind of emotions, sleepy cuddles, and endless wonder. As a newborn photographer, my goal is to capture those fleeting, precious moments in a way that feels natural and stress-free. I understand that those first few weeks are a beautiful (and sometimes not so beautiful) blur, so let's talk about what you can expect during your newborn session with me.

## A Relaxed, Baby-Led Approach

Just like my family sessions, where I let the little ones lead, newborn shoots are all about 'going with the flow.' At just a few days old, your baby is the boss! We'll work entirely around their needs, allowing ample time for feeding, soothing, and those essential cuddles. There's no rush. My priority is for everyone, especially your newborn, to have a calm and enjoyable experience.

## The Comfort of Home

Most families find the comfort of their own home ideal for newborn photography. And honestly, who can blame them? Avoiding a trip out with a brand-new baby is a gift!

### Worried About Your Home?

A common concern I hear is, 'My house is a mess!' or 'It's not big enough!' Trust me, I get it. With two kids and two large, indoor dogs, my home is never as clean or tidy as I’d like. But don't worry! When I arrive, we'll work together to find the best spot with beautiful natural light. I’ve done entire newborn shoots in 1 room with 1 window plenty of times and you’d never know when you look at the gallery. There’s plenty of variety. If we need to shift a few things or tidy a small area, we'll do it together. It's a team effort, and I'm here to make it easy.

## Outdoor Newborn Photography

Your newborn photos can also be taken at an outdoor location. Melbourne has so many beautiful coastal and forest locations to choose from. Is there a beach your toddler loves playing at? Or maybe there’s a forest that you and your partner love walking at? These photos are just as sweet as newborn photos taken in a home, especially if they’re at a location that holds sentimental value to you.

## When to Schedule Your Newborn Session

To truly capture that 'newborn curl' and those sleepy, delicate features, we typically aim for sessions within the first two weeks of life. While I'm happy to photograph your baby at any age, those early days are truly magical. After a few weeks, babies become more alert and start stretching out, which is wonderful but offers a different style of photography.

## What I Bring to Your Session

My approach is relaxed and easygoing. I bring everything we need for the session, including a beanbag to photograph your baby on, blankets, wraps and a few newborn outfits that you would’ve seen in some of my photos. I also encourage you to include any personal items that hold special meaning, like a handmade blanket, a family heirloom, or a favourite stuffed animal. These details add a personal touch to your images and create lasting memories.

## Including the Whole Family

While the focus will naturally be on your sweet baby, I will also take plenty of family photos of you altogether to document your first few days together as a family.

## Creating Lasting Memories

My aim is to create a calm, loving, and memorable experience for you and your newborn. I want you to look back on these photos and remember not just how tiny and adorable your baby was, but also how peaceful and joyful those first days were. Let's create beautiful memories that you'll treasure for a lifetime.
