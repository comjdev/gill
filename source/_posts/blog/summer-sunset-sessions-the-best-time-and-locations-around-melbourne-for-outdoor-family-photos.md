Long, golden summer evenings are made for barefoot cuddles, salty hair, and little ones chasing the last light across the grass. If you are dreaming of relaxed, sunlit portraits that feel like you on your best summer day, a sunset session is a beautiful fit. In this guide, I will help you choose the best time of day, share heat-friendly tips for kids, and suggest location types around Melbourne that suit natural, easygoing family photos. My sessions are gently guided and relaxed, and I am always happy to travel to places that mean something to you.

## What time of day is best for photoshoots in summer?

For outdoor family portraits, the best time of day is golden hour, the hour after sunrise or the hour before sunset. In Melbourne's summer, that usually means meeting in the early morning or in the evening when the sun sits lower, the light turns warm and flattering, and little faces are not squinting.

Evening golden hour is the sweet spot for many families. Colours glow, the sky softens, and the light wraps around you beautifully. Morning golden hour is lovely too if your children wake early and do best before breakfast. Both options avoid the harsh midday sun, which can create deep shadows and make it harder for kids to relax.

If you have toddlers with early bedtimes, we can plan a slightly earlier start in a shaded location where the light already feels soft. I bring gentle direction and lots of play so we can move quickly and make the most of that dreamy glow.

## How to time your session in Melbourne's long summer evenings

- Check sunset time for your chosen date, then aim to start 60 to 90 minutes before sunset. That gives us time to settle in, explore, and catch the final sparkle on the horizon.
- For sunrise sessions, meet 15 minutes before sunrise to capture the first light and quiet surroundings before the day warms up.
- Build in buffer time for parking, bathroom breaks, and a quick snack. The pace stays calm when no one feels rushed.

## Heat-friendly tips for kids

Summer sessions work best when everyone stays cool and comfortable. A few simple tweaks help a lot.

- Dress light. Choose breathable fabrics in soft, natural tones. Bring a spare T-shirt for little ones in case of spills or water play.
- Hydrate and snack. Pack water bottles and easy, mess-free snacks. Think crackers, fruit slices, or pouches.
- Shade matters. I scout for tree cover, dunes, or buildings that create natural shade. We rotate between sun and shade so cheeks do not overheat.
- Embrace movement. We keep kids moving with games, cuddles, and a little exploring. Movement feels natural and looks beautiful in photos.
- Bring comfort items. A favourite hat, muslin, or small toy can help a shy child settle and can even become part of the story.

## Where to take good photos in Melbourne, without naming every spot

Melbourne has a wealth of outdoor settings that suit relaxed family portraits. Choosing the right type of location sets the tone for your session and keeps kids happily engaged.

- Parks and open reserves. Think tall grass, winding paths, and stands of gum trees. These spaces offer a calm backdrop and room to play. Look for pockets of late light near tree lines, gentle hills, or small clearings.
- Bayside beaches. Soft sand, tidal shallows, and pastel skies are perfect for barefoot photos. We time it for low wind when possible and choose corners with dunes or rocks for variety and a bit of shelter.
- Urban greens and local wetlands. Boardwalks, reeds, and calm water create simple, reflective scenes. Great for little explorers who love to wander.
- Clifftop lookouts and coastal reserves. For families who love a breeze and big skies, higher vantage points give wide, cinematic images. We keep safety first, stay well back from edges, and opt for gentle trails.
- Your meaningful places. A favourite dog-walking route, the spot where you picnic on summer evenings, or the park near your home tells your story with heart. I happily travel to places that matter to you, and I will scout the light and backgrounds so it photographs beautifully.

If you would like more ideas, I can recommend location types that match your family's vibe, whether you want soft and grassy, coastal and playful, or something with interesting textures.

## What is the best time for family portraits?

The best time for family portraits is when your children will be happiest, paired with soft, flattering light. For most families, that means evening golden hour in summer. If evenings do not suit your little ones, sunrise can be a calm, beautiful alternative with cooler temperatures and fewer crowds.

We can also build your session around naps and mealtimes. I always plan a relaxed, gently guided flow with breaks for water, snacks, and cuddles. The aim is a fun evening out, not a formal photoshoot. When you are comfortable, your photos look and feel like you.

## What to wear for a summer sunset session

- Keep it simple and breathable. Cotton, linen, and light knits move well and keep you cool.
- Choose a colour palette. Neutrals with a few soft colours photograph well against greenery or sand.
- Think movement. Flowy dresses, relaxed shirts, and rolled sleeves add lift and texture in the breeze.
- Comfortable footwear. Barefoot on the beach, sandals or sneakers for parks, and a spare pair in the bag if kids go exploring.

I send a preparation guide before your session with more tips and inspiration, and I am happy to help you coordinate outfits.

## My approach on the day

I guide you gently, keep the mood light, and work with the natural rhythm of your family. We start with simple prompts to help you settle, then lean into candid moments, from tickles and shoulder rides to quiet hugs when the light turns golden. I pay attention to wind direction, where the sun sits, and how kids are feeling, and I adjust our plan so the experience stays relaxed.
