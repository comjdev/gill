In-home newborn photos in Melbourne: your questions answered!

I remember the day I brought both my babies home from the hospital and what a special time it is. Exhausting! But still special. Those first few days and weeks are an adjustment and a bit of a blur. If you’re wondering how an **in-home newborn session** in Melbourne works, you’re not alone, I get asked about it all the time and I’m here to walk you through it. My goal is always to make your experience relaxed and stress-free. Let’s go through some **common questions** you may have about **newborn photo sessions**.

When is the Best Time for Newborn Photos at your home in Melbourne?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions, especially for those expecting their first baby. Most newborn photographers aim for sessions to be done when babies are **between 5-14 days old**. This window is generally ideal for very sleepy, curly poses and babies tend to be more settled during their photos. 
However, as a **lifestyle newborn photographer in Melbourne**, my approach is very flexible. 

We can capture **beautiful newborn photos** anytime within your baby's first few weeks, or even up to 2-3 months old. While a younger baby might be sleepier, an older newborn is more alert, gives eye contact and often makes adorable, engaging expressions. The most important thing is that **you and your baby are comfortable**. 
It's a good idea to book your newborn session during your pregnancy to secure your date.

My baby is older than a few weeks. Does this mean it’s too late for newborn photos?

Absolutely not! It's never too late to capture those early moments. Many parents, after the initial whirlwind of welcoming a new baby, find themselves wishing they'd thought about **newborn photos** sooner.
The good news is that older babies (from a few weeks up to 3-4 months) are wonderful for baby photos! They are more alert, engage with you more, and give super cute expressions. My lifestyle approach is ideal for capturing their growing personalities and interactions. We’ll focus on the connections, cuddles and genuine moments between you, creating **newborn photos** you’ll love, regardless of age.

Preparing for your in-home newborn session and what to organise

One of the biggest advantages of an in-home newborn photoshoot is the minimal preparation required from you. Yay! As your **Melbourne newborn photographer**, I want this to be as stress-free as possible.
You don't need to deep-clean your entire house! We typically work in just a few key areas, like the master bedroom, living room, baby’s room/space, focusing on rooms with **beautiful natural light**. 
My main advice for preparing is to:
    • Warm the Room: A toasty room helps keep your baby sleepy and comfortable.
    • Feed Your Baby: A full belly often leads to a **happy, settled baby**. We can always take breaks for more feeds during the session if needed.
    • Simple Outfits: Think comfortable, neutral clothing for both baby, parents and siblings. I'll provide gentle guidance on this before your session and am happy to discuss and offer more personal suggestions.
    • Relax: My most important tip! Trust that **I'll guide you** through the process and the clutter that comes with family life isn’t going to stop us from getting beautiful photos.

Including siblings (especially toddlers!) in your newborn photos

It's completely normal to worry about including energetic toddlers in **newborn photos**! They are often the wild cards but they also bring so much joy and genuine interaction to your family photos.
My approach is always patient and flexible. We can either start the session by including them in some of the photos or wait a little bit, giving them time to observe and feel more comfortable to be included in the photos.
 
 Tips for success include:
    • Keep it fun! No pressure for perfect poses.
    • Bring snacks and favourite toys for them.
    • Let them be themselves. Genuine interactions are the most beautiful.
    • Have another adult available if possible to help, give a snack if needed etc
    • I capture real connections,  a gentle hug or even a silly face. These are the **newborn photos** that tell your family's unique story.

Do parents have to be in newborn photos?

This is a common concern, especially for new mums who might be feeling tired or self-conscious. Of course I will never force anybody to be in photos but I do gently recommend jumping in a couple, even if it's just your hands holding your baby, or beautiful close-ups of your faces. These are the **newborn photos** your child will look back on and I have no doubt they’d want to see their parent included. There’ll be no over the top poses from me that make you cringe, just photos that tell your story in a comfortable and authentic way to you.

What if my baby won't settle during our newborn photos?

This is perhaps the biggest worry for parents and I want to reassure you, it's completely normal, and it's perfectly fine! Your baby is the boss during our session.
My approach as your **Melbourne newborn photographer** is entirely baby-led. This means we take as many breaks as needed for feeding, changing or simply cuddling your little one. There's no rush or pressure. Sometimes the most beautiful and authentic newborn photos happen during a yawn, a stretch, or even a brief moment that shows their tiny (or big!) personality. Patience and flexibility are key and with over 10 years of experience, **I'm yet to meet a baby I couldn’t settle**.
