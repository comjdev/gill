Expecting a baby is a swirl of lists, flutters and "is this the right time?" decisions. If you are thinking about maternity photos in Melbourne's summer, you are in the right place. I specialise in relaxed, story-focused sessions that feel like a gentle stroll with a friend, not a performance. In this guide, you will find simple timing tips, comfort-first styling ideas, thoughts on including partners and siblings, and how to choose between an at-home session and a warm summer evening outside.

## The sweet spot for maternity photos

Most parents book their maternity session for late second to early third trimester, often around weeks 28 to 34. Your bump usually has a lovely, defined shape by then, and you are likely to have enough energy to enjoy the session. If you are showing earlier or carrying later, we can tweak that window to suit your comfort, your schedule and the look you love.

When should you book a maternity photoshoot? As soon as you know you want one. Popular summer evenings fill quickly in Melbourne, so reach out early to secure a time that suits your routine. I will guide you through choosing a location, planning outfits and picking the best hour for light.

What month of pregnancy is best for maternity photos? Many people land somewhere in month seven, give or take a couple of weeks. The key is how you feel and how your bump photographs. If you prefer a petite bump, book earlier. If you love a round, full silhouette, plan a little later, while keeping your comfort at the centre.

## Why comfort matters more than perfect posing

Beautiful images start with how you feel. My sessions are gently guided and relaxed, with simple prompts that help you move, breathe and connect. We focus on the story of this season rather than stiff poses. You can expect light direction, pauses for water, and space to settle into natural moments. Clients often tell me, "I was so nervous, and then it felt like hanging out with an old friend." That is exactly the experience I aim to deliver every time.

## Summer in Melbourne, made easy

Melbourne's summer light is gorgeous, especially at golden hour. For outdoor sessions, we usually aim for the hour after sunrise or the hour before sunset. In the evening, the light is warm and flattering. In the morning, it is calm and gentle. On hotter days, I will recommend shady parks or coastal spots with a sea breeze, and we will keep to one location so you stay cool.

Practical warm-weather tips:

- Bring chilled water, lip balm and a light snack.
- Choose breathable fabrics, and plan a quick change layer if needed.
- If you are bringing little ones, pack wipes and a small towel for sandy toes.
- Wear comfortable footwear for walking between spots, then swap to your chosen shoes for photos.

## At home or outdoors, which suits you?

Can you do a maternity shoot at home? Absolutely. In-home maternity sessions are calm, personal and beautifully light-filled. I will find the best natural light in your lounge or bedroom, and we will keep the flow easy. Being at home lets you rest between sets, change outfits without fuss and include sentimental details, like a nursery chair or baby blanket.

Outdoor sessions bring movement and atmosphere, whether that is a leafy park or the beach. Expect soft light, a bit of breeze and space to wander. If you love the idea of golden grass, pastel skies and playful, candid frames, the outdoors might be perfect for you.

You can also blend both, starting at home and finishing with a short sunset stroll if timing allows.

## What to wear for a maternity photoshoot

Comfort first, always. Choose pieces that make you feel lovely and free to move.

- Silhouettes: Wrap dresses, empire waist styles and stretchy knits flatter the bump and photograph beautifully. A fitted ribbed dress under a floaty layer can add texture and shape.
- Fabrics: Linen, cotton, chiffon and soft knits breathe and catch the light. Avoid heavy or stiff materials in the heat.
- Colours: Coordinate rather than match. Pick two or three complementary tones, and lean toward muted or mid tones over bright white or neon. Soft sage, oatmeal, terracotta, dusty blue and cream are favourites in summer light.
- Partners and kids: Draw their outfits from your palette. Think simple tees, cotton shirts, relaxed dresses or shorts that feel true to your family.
- Practical extras: A spare top, a light cardigan or overshirt, a lint roller and comfortable walking shoes for transitions.

If you prefer a little styling help, I provide guidance before your session and we can review outfit options together to find a cohesive look.

## Should your partner or older children join?

Yes, if you want your images to tell the fuller story of this season. Partners add connection and support, and siblings bring joy and movement. I keep prompts simple and fun, like walking hand in hand, whispering a secret to the baby or resting hands on the bump while we chat. If you are craving a quiet portrait-led session, you can absolutely come solo, then invite family in for a few frames at the end.

## How I help you feel at ease in front of the camera

Most clients start by saying, "We're a bit awkward." That is normal. I keep the atmosphere calm and friendly, with gentle guidance and easy prompts. We move, we pause, we chat. You will never be left wondering what to do. My focus is on connection and storytelling, so you can relax into natural moments while I watch the light, the wind and your comfort.

## Planning your summer session timeline

- Enquire early: If you are hoping for a weekend golden hour in January or February, get in touch as soon as you can. We will pencil in your ideal window and keep a little flexibility around weather.
- Choose your setting: At home for intimacy and comfort, or outdoors for ambience and movement. I will recommend locations based on light and heat.
- Prep the day: Drink water, eat a light meal, and keep your schedule gentle. Open blinds in the rooms you love if we are shooting at home.
- Expect a relaxed flow: We will take breaks, swap layers and follow your energy.
