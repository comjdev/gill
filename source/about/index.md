## Hi, my name is Gill

And I have been capturing the special moments in peoples lives with timeless and natural photography, for the last 10 years here in Melbourne.

But before I get into that, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself.

I am a wife, and a mother to my two beautiful kids. Aside from photography, my family is the most important thing in the world to me. And if I’m not taking photos for my clients, I’m documenting my days with those that I love.

### Motherhood is my muse for taking the most beautiful images for my clients

Because although my kids can be the best at pushing my buttons on occasion, they have also provided my biggest motivation to create the most incredible imagery for my clients.

My children are full of so much love, and it is my passion to capture that same feeling of love for others, whether it be at their wedding, a family shoot, a newborn shoot or a maternity shoot in the area of Melbourne.

### It’s the love in the little moments that matter

I studied professional writing in Melbourne prior to studying photography, and these combined skills have helped me cultivate an ability to tell beautiful stories through imagery.

## Your Story

### Because my photography is all ABOUT telling a story

It’s about capturing the important moments in your life and the details that make it so special, within that moment.

I take a lifestyle approach to my photography, and I keep it natural and honest at every shoot. You can always expect bad jokes, fun, conversation and a lot of laughter with me, so the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable as I capture the “real” you.

I work with natural light to ensure every image is beautifully lit, and I help you find the joy in both movement and connection on the day.

If necessary, I provide guidance to ensure you get the best out of your session, however my shoots are otherwise unposed. This allows me to capture more relaxed and natural images on the day.

## Your experience

### But, maybe you haven’t had a photoshoot before, and aren’t sure what to expect?

Not many people feel that comfortable having their photo taken. And that’s ok.
I get it, because given the choice I’d always choose to be behind the camera instead of in front of it.

But in my shoots, we chat and laugh so you feel relaxed throughout the session. And soon you won’t even notice my camera, which is when the magic really happens.

**I create images that you want to hang on the walls of your Melbourne home.**

I create images that will make you proud, and nostalgic. And images that will make you smile every time you pass them. I capture the moments that you never want to forget. And I can’t wait to capture yours.

I am so looking forward to working with you.
