    - Welcoming a tiny new human into your family is a big deal. My newborn photography sessions are all about capturing the wonder and beauty of your brand new baby in a natural and loving way. I take a super relaxed approach, capturing the tiniest of details that make your baby so special, and the new moments between you, just as you are.

    - I remember those early days with my own babies. Mostly I remember the sleep deprivation but I also remember looking at their tiny details in awe and wanting to remember it all. This is why the focus of each newborn shoot is on your sweet baby and all their little details. Capturing plenty of photos of you together is equally as important. We’ll document those early days together, moments you'll undoubtedly want to look back on and remember.
    - My newborn photography sessions are designed to be a relaxed and laid-back experience for everyone. I understand that navigating life with a newborn can be unpredictable, so I bring along everything we need for the photoshoot – soft blankets, wraps etc. You don't need to worry about a thing. We’ll include those everyday spaces that are now a part of your new life, the spot you feed in quietly, their first room or even snuggled up in bed together, we’ll capture it all. I’ll also send you my Newborn Guide beforehand to answer any questions you might have and give you further information.

  subtitle: The best place to have your newborn photos

    - Please don't feel any pressure to have a perfectly tidy house to have newborn photos taken. You've just welcomed a baby into your world, and that's all that truly matters. I'm happy to work with whatever your home looks like. Together, we'll take a look around and decide on the best spots within your home to capture your baby’s newborn photos, adjusting anything as needed to use natural light and create a comfortable setting. Another wonderful option is to have your newborn photos taken at an outdoor location, especially if you have one that is meaningful to you.
    - Newborn photos are generally taken within the first two weeks of life when babies tend to be sleepier. However, I completely understand that this timeframe might not feel right for every family. If you don't feel quite ready for a photoshoot during those initial days, please don't hesitate to discuss this with me. We can absolutely plan your baby photography session for a slightly older age when you and your baby feel more settled and comfortable. The most important thing is to capture these precious moments when the time is right for your family.
