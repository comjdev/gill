    - Welcoming a tiny new human into your family is a big deal. My newborn photography sessions in Melbourne are all about capturing the wonder and beauty of your brand new baby in a natural and loving way. I take a super relaxed approach, capturing the tiniest of details that make your baby so special, and the new moments between you, just as you are.

    - I remember those early days with my own babies. Mostly I remember the sleep deprivation but I also remember looking at their tiny details in awe and wanting to remember it all. This is why the focus of each newborn shoot is on your sweet baby and all their little details. Capturing plenty of photos of you together is equally as important. We'll document those early days together, moments you'll undoubtedly want to look back on and remember.
    - My newborn photography sessions are designed to be a relaxed and laid-back experience for everyone. I understand that navigating life with a newborn can be unpredictable, so I bring along everything we need for the photoshoot â€“ soft blankets, wraps etc. You don't need to worry about a thing. We'll include those everyday spaces that are now a part of your new life, the spot you feed in quietly, their first room or even snuggled up in bed together, we'll capture it all. I'll also send you my Melbourne Newborn Guide beforehand to answer any questions you might have and give you further information.

    - Please don't feel any pressure to have a perfectly tidy house to have newborn photos taken. You've just welcomed a baby into your world, and that's all that truly matters. I'm happy to work with whatever your home looks like. Together, we'll take a look around and decide on the best spots within your home to capture your baby's newborn photos, adjusting anything as needed to use natural light and create a comfortable setting. Another wonderful option is to have your newborn photos taken at an outdoor location somewhere in Melbourne, especially if you have one that is meaningful to you.
    - Newborn photos are generally taken within the first two weeks of life when babies tend to be sleepier. However, I completely understand that this timeframe might not feel right for every family. If you don't feel quite ready for a photoshoot during those initial days, please don't hesitate to discuss this with me. We can absolutely plan your baby photography session in Melbourne for a slightly older age when you and your baby feel more settled and comfortable. The most important thing is to capture these precious moments when the time is right for your family.

faqs:
  - question: What should we wear for our family session?
    answer: |
      Choose coordinating colors rather than matching outfits. Avoid bright neon colors and large logos. Earth tones, pastels, and neutral colors work well. Most importantly, wear something you feel comfortable and confident in. I recommend bringing a change of clothes for the kids in case of accidents.

  - question: How long does a family session typically last?
    answer: Family sessions in Melbourne usually last 1-2 hours, depending on the size of your family and the location. This gives us plenty of time to capture a variety of shots while keeping everyone comfortable and engaged.

  - question: What if my children don't cooperate during the session?
    answer: Don't worry! I'm experienced with children of all ages and temperaments. I use games, songs, and playful activities to keep kids engaged. Some of the best photos come from candid moments when children are being themselves. I'll work with your family's natural dynamics.

  - question: Can we include our pets in the family session?
    answer: Absolutely! Pets are part of the family too. Just let me know in advance so I can plan accordingly. I recommend bringing treats and toys to help keep pets focused during the session.

  - question: When will we receive our photos?
    answer: You'll receive a sneak peek within 48 hours of your session. The full gallery will be ready within 2-3 weeks, depending on the season and my current workload.

  - question: Do you offer prints and albums?
    answer: Yes! I offer professional printing services and beautiful albums to help you preserve your family memories. I can also recommend the best places to print your digital files in Melbourne if you prefer to handle printing yourself.
