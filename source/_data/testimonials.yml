She put me and my children at ease and kept reminding me that the chaos of my children was all part of the shoot as they are who they are. We got some wonderful natural photos which I'm very happy with. Thank you Gill!!"

    text: "I can't recommend Gill enough for our baby's two-week photoshoot! From the moment she arrived, she felt like an old friend, which made the whole experience so comfortable. She was incredible with our little one, using her gentle settling techniques to keep the baby calm, and we actually picked up so many helpful tips that we still use today‚Äîthree months later!\n\nThe photos turned out absolutely gorgeous and natural, capturing the essence of those early days perfectly. The quality was top-notch, and we were blown away by how quickly she delivered them. The download process was super easy, and our friends and family loved browsing through the online album.\n\nOverall, it was a fantastic experience, and we couldn't have asked for more. If you're looking for a talented photographer who truly cares, Gill is the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

She makes us feel very comfortable, is very responsive and can provide as much or as little advice as you would like regarding the process. She is also very punctual and her photos are beyond amazing. Could not recommend highly enough."

    text: "We met Gill 5 years ago after my partner and I got engaged. Gill has photographed all the big moments in our life in recent years including our wedding (which included a complementary engagement photoshoot!), our two babies newborn shoots and various family photos since. We have had 5 or 6 photoshoots with Gill (it's so many I'm losing count üòÖ). Our close friends also had Gill photograph their wedding because they loved our wedding photos so much! We cannot recommend Gill highly enough. She is warm, caring, professional, a great communicator and always takes extra time in shoots where kids and pets are involved. 5/5 stars ‚≠ê"

    text: "We have had two family photoshoots done by Gill and I couldn't recommend her enough. We absolutely love the photos from both photoshoots. We aren't naturals infront of the camera and it was a bit chaotic with two young kids but Gill was so lovely and great with the kids too. She captured a beautiful mixture of posed and natural photographs in a stunning location!"
