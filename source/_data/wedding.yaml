faqs:
  - question: How far in advance should we book our wedding photographer?
    answer: |
      I recommend booking your wedding photographer 12-18 months in advance, especially for popular wedding dates (spring and fall). I only take on a limited number of weddings per year to ensure I can give each couple my full attention and creativity.

  - question: Do you offer engagement sessions?
    answer: Yes! An engagement session is included in all wedding packages. This is a great opportunity for us to get to know each other, for you to get comfortable in front of the camera, and to create beautiful images for your save-the-dates or wedding website.

  - question: How many hours of coverage do we need?
    answer: Most couples choose 8-10 hours of coverage, which typically includes getting ready, ceremony, portraits, and reception. I can customize coverage based on your timeline and needs. For destination weddings or longer celebrations, I offer extended coverage options.

  - question: Do you travel for weddings?
    answer: Absolutely! I love traveling for weddings and have photographed celebrations across Victoria and beyond. Travel fees are reasonable and transparent. I'm also available for destination weddings throughout Australia and internationally.

  - question: What if it rains on our wedding day?
    answer: |
      Don't worry! I'm experienced in shooting beautiful weddings in any weather. I'll work with you to create a backup plan and can capture stunning images indoors or with creative use of umbrellas and covered areas. Some of the most romantic and unique wedding photos come from rainy days.

  - question: When will we receive our wedding photos?
    answer: You'll receive a sneak peek of 20-30 images within 48 hours of your wedding. The full gallery will be ready within 4-6 weeks, depending on the season and my current workload. I take great care in editing each image to ensure they're perfect.

  - question: Do you offer wedding albums and prints?
    answer: Yes! I offer beautiful, custom-designed wedding albums and professional printing services. Many couples choose to invest in albums and prints to preserve their memories in tangible form. I can also recommend the best places to print your digital files.

  - question: Can you help us with our wedding timeline?
    answer: Absolutely! I'll work with you and your other vendors to create a timeline that ensures we capture all the important moments while keeping your day flowing smoothly. I'm experienced in coordinating with wedding planners, venues, and other vendors.
