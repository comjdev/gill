  subtitle: The best place to have your maternity photos taken

    - Whether you envision your maternity photos taking place in the familiar comfort of your own home or at an outdoor location, the choice is entirely yours. My priority is to create an environment where you feel completely at ease and most comfortable. Remembering my own pregnancies, I know this exciting time isn't always the most physically comfortable. My maternity photography sessions are intentionally relaxed and unhurried. We'll move at your pace, ensuring you feel supported and completely at ease throughout our time together.
    - If you're leaning towards having an in-home session for your pregnancy photos, forget the pressure of a perfectly styled home. I have a knack for discovering those hidden pockets of beautiful light within any space. Even a simple spot with soft window light can become the backdrop for relaxed and intimate pregnancy photography. I embrace the authenticity of your home and see it as part of your unique story.

    - Each maternity session is all about celebrating you and your bump. I remember from my own pregnancies just how long each week felt but in reality, it's such a short window of time when you grow your baby. We'll focus on capturing the beauty of your bump and the quiet strength of motherhood on the horizon. These maternity photos are a way to honour this beautiful milestone and create memories of a time that passes by all too quickly.
    - I love to include partners in maternity sessions, capturing the shared joy and anticipation of your growing family. Soon-to-be siblings are also very welcome, allowing us to create those first precious memories of connection and excitement for their new sibling. These pregnancy photos become a beautiful keepsake of your expanding love. My goal as your pregnancy photographer is to make this a relaxed and enjoyable memory-making experience for everyone.

faqs:
  - question: When is the best time to schedule a maternity session?
    answer: The ideal time is between 28-36 weeks of pregnancy. At this stage, your bump is beautifully round and prominent, but you're still comfortable enough to move around and pose. We want to capture you at your most comfortable and confident.

  - question: What should I wear for my maternity session?
    answer: |
      I recommend form-fitting dresses or tops that showcase your bump beautifully. Flowy fabrics, lace, and soft materials work well. Many clients also love the look of a simple white or black top with jeans or a skirt. I can provide styling advice and have some beautiful maternity dresses available for clients to borrow.

  - question: Can my partner and children be included in the session?
    answer: Absolutely! Many clients choose to include their partner and older children in some of the images. These family maternity photos become treasured memories that capture the excitement of the whole family before the new arrival.

  - question: Where can we have the session?
    answer: We can shoot in the comfort of your home, at a beautiful outdoor location, or in my studio. Popular outdoor locations include parks, beaches, and gardens. I'll help you choose a location that reflects your style and comfort level.

  - question: How should I prepare for the session?
    answer: |
      Get plenty of rest the night before and stay hydrated. Consider having your hair and makeup done professionally, or keep it natural - whatever makes you feel most beautiful. I recommend avoiding tight clothing for a few hours before the session to avoid marks on your skin.

  - question: When will I receive my photos?
    answer: You'll receive a sneak peek within 48 hours of your session. The full gallery will be ready within 2-3 weeks, depending on the season and my current workload.

  - question: Do you offer hair and makeup services?
    answer: I can recommend professional hair and makeup artists who specialize in maternity sessions. Many clients choose to have this done to feel extra special and confident during their session.
